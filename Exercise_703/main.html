            Ikeja replaced Lagos as the state capital, and Abuja replaced Lagos as the federal capital territory of Nigeria. <br> Lagos, however, remained the unofficial seat of many government agencies.<br> 
            The city's population is centred on Lagos Island, in Lagos Lagoon, on the Bight of Benin in the Gulf of Guinea. <br>
            Lagos is Nigeriaâ€™s largest city and one of the largest in sub-Saharan Africa. <br>
            Geographically, Lagos is locaed in the southwest of Nigeria, on the coast of the Bight of Benin. It is bounded by the state of Ogun to the north and east, by the Bight of Benin to the south, and by the Republic of Benin to the west.<br>
            From 1914 to 1954 the area included in the state was administered by the British as part of the colony of Nigeria.
